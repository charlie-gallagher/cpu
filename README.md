# Virtual CPU
This is a pretty informal project I thought up to keep my C skills sharp. I'm
going to build a virtual CPU, painfully simple and using no external libraries.
At the moment, the plan is to support a few commands, focus on the data
structures, and force the poor user to write raw op codes to populate the CPU's
128 byte memory. See my notes document for some of my current ideas. The CPU
will be based on the Motorolla 6502, since that's the architecture I'm most
familiar with.
