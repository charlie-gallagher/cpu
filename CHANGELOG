v0.3.5
  - Added true indirect addressing mode
  - Renamed indexed addressing mode to "_X" mode

v0.3.4
  - Once again updated conditional branching to better match the 6502's
  behavior. Now instructions are relative to the next value of the PC.

v0.3.3
  - Fixed bug that caused single-character labels to be skipped
  - Fixed a conditional branching bug that made it hard to branch
    forward. Now both forward and backward branching are relative
    to the instruction, not the operand. 

v0.3.2
  - Added carry flag
  - Replaced ADD and SUB with ADC and SBC to better match the 6502 
    instruction set

v0.3.1
  - Added explicit preprocessor before label processor and RAM loader
  - Cleaned up some print statements
  - Added the usage of a temporary file
    - If the user exits via signal (e.g., CTRL-C), the temporary file will not be deleted

v0.3.0
  - Added label preprocessor and data structure

v0.2.1
  - Added BMI (branch if minus flag set) instruction
